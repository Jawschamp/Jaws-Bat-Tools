# Simp-Bat-Tools

Is a list of files that make naviagting mostly with Command Prompt a lot less clunky and more efficient
You can think of this as a keybind for spesific actions without having to click that menu (if it's even a thing).

# Suggestion
If you would like to use these tools even more efficiently:
* 1) Open the Windows menu (via Windows key) type in ``"edit"`` and look for "Edit the system environment variables"

* 2) From here look at: [Editing System Environment Variables](https://www.imatest.com/docs/editing-system-environment-variables/#Windows)
